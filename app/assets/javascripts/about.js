var missionStatement ="Our ultimate goal is to eliminate the frustrating barriers that surrounds medical education and to make it more " +
    "accessible to all students by creating a site dedicated to the needs of the modern medical student.  Our videos are designed to be: fun, " +
    "interactive, practical, contextual, high-yield, and time sensitive, and we are always looking for new ways to improve on our work.  " +
    "The intent of our videos is not to teach every detail in existence, but to instead provide a contextual thinking framework that students" +
    " can use to build their medical knowledge.  Rest assured that factual correctness and quality are very important to us - as our videos " +
    "are checked for factual correctness by experienced and accomplished medical educators. " +
    "<p/>" +
    "We are, and always intend to be, a student run organization - but one that also has support from nationally recognized and " +
    "accredited medical organizations. " +
    "<p/>" +
    "If you would like to join us in our mission, please contact us!  And please feel free to offer any advice or suggestions on how we " +
    "can improve your UndergroundMed experience!";
